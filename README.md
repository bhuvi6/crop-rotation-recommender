# Crop Rotation & Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Crop Rotation and Recommendation System** that suggests optimal crop rotations or alternative crops based on climate, soil, and market data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recommend sustainable crop rotation practices.
- Maintain soil fertility and reduce risks of monoculture.
- Use AI/ML to provide personalized crop suggestions.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` → Store datasets (soil, climate, crop yield, market prices).
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for exploration & experiments.
- `src/` → Source code (data processing, model training, recommendation engine).
- `reports/` → Documentation, weekly milestones, presentations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- APIs for climate & market data

## 🌱 Sustainability Impact
- Promotes biodiversity and soil health.
- Prevents depletion of natural resources.
- Helps farmers adapt to climate variability.
